Exercises
=========

The solution to all tasks is located at the end. Please try to solve them by yourself and look at the solutions only if you get stuck or want to validate your work.

Docker Exercise
---------------

The exercise consists of performing the whole delivery lifecycle of an application using only Docker. We'll test the application, and build and push a Docker container. The service we'll use is written in Go. Since this training is language-agnostic, you are not expected to know the language. You will not need any additional tools. All the tasks should be completed with Docker.

Before diving into exercises, please SSH into the machine you are assigned and enter the */mnt/training-books-ms/exercises* directory. All the code you'll need is inside.

Docker
------

### Test the code

The command to test the code is as follows.

```bash
sh -c "go get -t && go test --cover -v"
```

Since Go is not installed on the server, you should use the [golang](https://hub.docker.com/_/golang/) image available in the Docker Hub.

The requirements for this task are as follows.

* Remove the container after the execution of the tests is finished
* The current host directory should be mounted as the */go/src/docker-flow* volume.
* The */go/src/docker-flow* inside the container should be the working directory.
* Run the above mentioned command

For additional information, please consult [Docker Run](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/run/) documentation.

### Build the binary

The command to build the binary is as follows.

```bash
sh -c "go get && go build -v -o docker-flow-proxy"
```

The requirements for this task are as follows.

* Remove the container after the execution of the tests is finished
* The current host directory should be mounted as the */go/src/docker-flow* volume.
* The */go/src/docker-flow* inside the container should be working directory.
* Run the above mentioned command

For additional information, please consult [Docker Run](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/run/) documentation.

### Create Dockerfile that defines the Docker image

The Dockerfile that we'll create has the following requirements.

* It should extend the `haproxy:1.6-alpine` image. Alpine is the smallest base image. Extending it will guarantee that our container is as small as it can be.
* Define maintainer's name and email address.
* It should download *Consul Template* binary (*https://releases.hashicorp.com/consul-template/0.13.0/consul-template_0.13.0_linux_amd64.zip*), place it into the */usr/local/bin/* directory with the name *consul-template*, and make it executable. The following set of Linux commands would accomplish this requirement.

```bash
apk add --no-cache --virtual .build-deps curl unzip

curl -SL https://releases.hashicorp.com/consul-template/0.13.0/consul-template_0.13.0_linux_amd64.zip -o /usr/local/bin/consul-template.zip

unzip /usr/local/bin/consul-template.zip -d /usr/local/bin/

rm -f /usr/local/bin/consul-template.zip

chmod +x /usr/local/bin/consul-template
```

* Create a soft link from */lib/libc.musl-x86_64.so.1* to */lib64/ld-linux-x86-64.so.2*. The following set of Linux commands would accomplish this requirement.

```bash
mkdir /lib64

ln -s /lib/libc.musl-x86_64.so.1 /lib64/ld-linux-x86-64.so.2
```

* Create a directory */cfg/tmpl*.
* Copy *haproxy.cfg* to */cfg/haproxy.cfg*.
* Copy *haproxy.tmpl* to */cfg/tmpl/haproxy.tmpl*.
* Copy *docker-flow-proxy* to */usr/local/bin/docker-flow-proxy*.
* Add *execute permissions to */usr/local/bin/docker-flow-proxy*.
* Define an environment variable *CONSUL_ADDRESS* with an empty string as value.
* Expose ports *80* and *8080*.
* Define `docker-flow-proxy server` as container's command.

For additional information, please consult [Dockerfile reference](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/builder/) documentation.

### Build the image and push it to the local registry

The requirements for this task are as follows.

* Build the image defined in the *Dockerfile* and name it *localhost:5000/docker-flow-proxy*
* Push the newly built image to the private registry running in *localhost:5000*.

For additional information, please consult [Docker Build](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/build/), [Docker Tag](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/tag/), and [Docker Push](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/push/) documentation.

### Run latest version of the container

The requirements for this task are as follows.

* List all the Docker processes.
* If the container with the same name is already running, remove it.
* Run the newly built container.

  * The container should run in background.
  * The name of the container should be *docker-flow-proxy*.
  * Internal port *80* should be exposed to the host as *8081*.
  * Internal port *8080* should be exposed to the host as *8082*.

For additional information, please consult [Docker Run](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/run/) documentation.

Exercise Solutions
==================

Docker Exercise Solution
------------------------

### Test the code

```bash
cd /mnt/training-books-ms/exercises

docker run --rm \
    -v $PWD:/go/src/docker-flow \
    -w /go/src/docker-flow \
    golang \
    sh -c "go get -t && go test --cover -v"
```

The explanation of the arguments is as follows.

* The `--rm` argument automatically removes the container when it exits
* The `-v $PWD:/go/src/docker-flow` argument mounts the current directory (`$PWD`) as `/go/src/docker-flow`.
* The `go get -t && go test --cover -v` argument is the command that is run inside the container

### Build the binary

```bash
docker run --rm \
    -v $PWD:/go/src/docker-flow \
    -w /go/src/docker-flow \
    golang \
    sh -c "go get && go build -v -o docker-flow-proxy"
```

The explanation of the arguments is as follows.

* The `--rm` argument automatically removes the container when it exits
* The `-v $PWD:/go/src/docker-flow` argument mounts the current directory (`$PWD`) as `/go/src/docker-flow`.
* The `go get && go build -v -o docker-flow-proxy` argument is the command that is run inside the container

### Create Dockerfile that defines the Docker image

The content of the *Dockerfile* should be as follows.

```
FROM haproxy:1.6-alpine
MAINTAINER 	Viktor Farcic <vfarcic@cloudbees.com>

    curl -SL https://releases.hashicorp.com/consul-template/0.13.0/consul-template_0.13.0_linux_amd64.zip -o /usr/local/bin/consul-template.zip && \
    unzip /usr/local/bin/consul-template.zip -d /usr/local/bin/ && \
    rm -f /usr/local/bin/consul-template.zip && \
    chmod +x /usr/local/bin/consul-template && \
    apk del .build-deps

RUN mkdir /lib64 && ln -s /lib/libc.musl-x86_64.so.1 /lib64/ld-linux-x86-64.so.2
RUN mkdir -p /cfg/tmpl

COPY haproxy.tmpl /cfg/tmpl/haproxy.tmpl
COPY docker-flow-proxy /usr/local/bin/docker-flow-proxy
RUN chmod +x /usr/local/bin/docker-flow-proxy

ENV CONSUL_ADDRESS ""
EXPOSE 80
EXPOSE 8080

CMD ["docker-flow-proxy", "server"]
```

The explanation of the Dockerfile instructions is as follows.

* The `FROM` instruction sets the Base Image to *haproxy:1.6-alpine*.
* The `MAINTAINER` instruction allows you to set the Author field of the generated images.
* The `RUN` instruction executes any commands and commit the results.
* The `COPY` instruction copies new files or directories from the source (the first argument) and adds them to the filesystem of the container at the destination path (the second argument).
* The `ENV` instruction sets the environment variable (the first argument) to the value (the second argument).
* The `EXPOSE` instruction informs Docker that the container listens on the specified network ports at runtime.
* The `CMD` instruction provides defaults for an executing container.

Please use your favourite editor (e.g. *vi*) to create the *Dockerfile* or `echo` the contents.

```bash

### Build the image and push it to the local registry

```bash
docker build -t localhost:5000/docker-flow-proxy .

docker push localhost:5000/docker-flow-proxy
```

The `build` command builds Docker images from a Dockerfile and a context. The explanation of the `build` arguments is as follows.

* The `-t` argument specifies the name of the image. In this case, the name is prefixed with the IP and the port of the registry where the image will be pushed.
* The last argument is the path of the context. In this case, the `.` (dot) argument is translated to the current directory.

The `push` command is used to send images to the Docker Hub registry or to a self-hosted one. The explanation of the `tag` arguments is as follows.

* The first argument represents the image that will be pushed. It is prefixed with the IP and the port of the registry where the image will be pushed.

### Run latest version of the container

```bash
docker ps -a

docker rm -f docker-flow-proxy

docker run -d \
    --name docker-flow-proxy \
    -p 8081:80 -p 8082:8080 \
    localhost:5000/docker-flow-proxy
```

The explanation of the `ps` arguments is as follows.

* The `-a` argument shows all containers (default shows just running)

The explanation of the `rm` arguments is as follows.

* The `-f` argument forces the removal of a running container.
* The `docker-flow-proxy` argument is the name of the container that should be removed.

The explanation of the `run` arguments is as follows.

* The `-d` argument runs the container in background.
* The `--name` argument assigns a name to the container.
* The `-p` argument publishes a container's port to the host. In this case, each value is split with colon (*:*). The left hand-side represents the port that should be published on the host while the right-hand side is the port defined internally inside the container.
* The last argument is the name of the image.

Jenkins Pipeline Exercise Solution
----------------------------------

### Create a new Pipeline job

* Open the Jenkins UI.
* Click the *New Item* link from the left-hand menu.
* Type *docker-flow-proxy* in the *Item Name* field, select the *Pipeline* job type, and click the *OK* button.

### Clone the code from the GitHub repository

Write the following script inside the *Pipeline Script* field.

```groovy
node("cd") {
    git branch: 'pipeline', url: 'https://github.com/cloudbees/training-books-ms'
}
```

The explanation of the snippet is as follows.

* The steps executed inside the `node` block will run in one of the slaves named or labeled *cd*.

### Run the tests and build the binary

Add the following snippet below the `git` instruction inside the *Pipeline Script* field.

```groovy
    stage 'test'
    docker.image("golang").inside('-u 0:0') {
        sh 'ln -s $PWD /go/src/docker-flow'
        sh 'cd /go/src/docker-flow && go get -t && go test --cover -v'
        sh 'cd /go/src/docker-flow && go build -v -o docker-flow-proxy'
    }
```

The explanation of the snippet is as follows.

* The `stage` instruction defines a group of steps.
* The `docker.image` instruction specifies the name of the image that will be used.
* The arguments set for the `inside` function will be passed as Docker `run` arguments.
* The steps executed inside the `docker.image.inside` block will run inside the specified container.

### Build the image and push it to the local registry

Add the following snippet below the `docker.image("golang").inside('-u 0:0')` block inside the *Pipeline Script* field.

```bash
    stage 'build'
    docker.build('localhost:5000/docker-flow-proxy')
    docker.image('localhost:5000/docker-flow-proxy').push()
```

The explanation of the snippet is as follows.

* The `stage` instruction defines a group of steps.
* The `docker.build` instruction builds the image called `localhost:5000/docker-flow-proxy`. The name itself follows the *[REGISTRY]/[IMAGE_NAME]* format.
* The `docker.image` instruction returns *Container*. The `push` command is given to the container *localhost:5000/docker-flow-proxy*.


### Archive the binary

Add the following snippet below the `docker.image('localhost:5000/docker-flow-proxy').push()` instruction inside the *Pipeline Script* field.

```bash
    archive 'docker-flow-proxy'
```

The explanation of the snippet is as follows.

* The `archive` instruction stores all the files that match the specified pattern.

### Run latest version of the container

```bash
checkpoint 'deploy'

node('production') {
    stage 'deploy'
    try {
        sh 'docker rm -f docker-flow-proxy'
    } catch(e) { }
    docker.image('localhost:5000/docker-flow-proxy').run('--name docker-flow-proxy -p 8081:80 -p 8082:8080')
}
```

The explanation of the snippet is as follows.

* In case of a system failure, the `checkpoint` instruction allows restart of the job from that point.
* The steps executed inside the `node` block will run in one of the slaves named or labeled *production*.
* The `sh` step is used to run the Docker `rm` command that removes the container. To prevent possible failure in case such a container does not exist, the step is wrapped inside an `try/catch` statement.

### The complete Pipeline script

The complete script is listed below.

```bash
node("cd") {
    git branch: 'pipeline', url: 'https://github.com/cloudbees/training-books-ms'

    stage 'test'
    docker.image("golang").inside('-u 0:0') {
        sh 'ln -s $PWD /go/src/docker-flow'
        sh 'cd /go/src/docker-flow && go get -t && go test --cover -v'
        sh 'cd /go/src/docker-flow && go build -v -o docker-flow-proxy'
    }

    stage 'build'
    docker.build('localhost:5000/docker-flow-proxy')
    docker.image('localhost:5000/docker-flow-proxy').push()
    archive 'docker-flow-proxy'
}

checkpoint 'deploy'

node('production') {
    stage 'deploy'
    try {
        sh 'docker rm -f docker-flow-proxy'
    } catch(e) { }
    docker.image('localhost:5000/docker-flow-proxy').run('--name docker-flow-proxy -p 8081:80 -p 8082:8080')
}
```
