TomTom Meeting Summary (4th of April 2016)
==========================================

* Not much interest within the company
* "Navigation" team is using TeamCity. They spoke with someone and were not impressed with Jenkins.
* "PND" team is using two CJE masters. Involved with Docker. Interested in 60 minutes focused on Docker integration. Francois Mayer is PND manager. Michael Waysman is architect. Use AWS with CentOS 7 and use it for Docker integration.
* "Maps" or "CPP" team is the biggest Jenkins user (three masters). Lots of jobs.
* "Developers support" team. Many custom slaves connected to a master (mostly laptops, desktops, and VMs). Separate LDAPs on masters. Cannot manage users and slaves centrally. Requesting help with Puppet.
* Suggestion to dedicate 4 days of the engagement (out of 7 left) to the support team and make sure that CJOCs and CJEs are up and running.
